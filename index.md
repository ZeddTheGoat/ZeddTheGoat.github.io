## About Me

I obtained my M.S. from the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2024, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dacheng Tao, Prof. Xinmei Tian, and Dr. Yuxuan Du. Prior to that, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with honors in Artificial Intelligence from the School of the Gifted Young at USTC in 2021. Currently, I am conducting research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, with a special focus on:

- **AI for Quantum Computing:** Utilizing AI methods to enhance the realization of quantum computing in the NISQ era.
- **Quantum Inspired Algorithems:** Developing novel quantum algorithms to accelerate classical computing.
